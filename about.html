<p>My name is Ryan Conklin and I am a senior software development engineer in test.<br>

    I want to start off by saying I love this work. Technology is my passion and when I take interest in something I consume all the subject matter I can get my hands on. I work until I'm able to teach and write tutorials of my own on whatever is dominating my time.

<br>Eat. Sleep. Build. Repeat.<br>

I have extensive experience with many different technical platforms. From design, development, and testing, I have worked in various fields. Among these are positions like game design and development, QA engineer, software development engineer in test, VoIP administration, and web application development. I look forward to my next challenge, examples of my work and references upon request.

What currently has my attention:
Infrastructure as code, configuration as code, and policy as code. How tools like Terraform give us the power to use ALL of the cloud and not just a single provider. Finally, how QA will write tests in a spiffy automated way that will exercise and assert these distributed systems that are fully built in code and live in the cloud. Writing tests at the application level no longer provides the coverage development teams need. Chaos engineering and test coverage at the IaC level is quickly becoming the new standard!
